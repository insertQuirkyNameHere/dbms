My DBMS Project is entitled "Career Portal"
The aim is to build an application that automates the Placements mechanisms in a college

## Branches
The main branch will contain the final product.
Up until such a time, however, the sen branch will be the main working branch

### main branch
The main branch only has the user model and user model manager at this time

### sen branch
The sen branch has defined accounts, student, spc, faculty and placement modules.

#### student module
The student module is nearing completion. Students can now enter their details and request edits. Viewing company list functionality is awaiting further
"placement" module development

#### spc module
SPC module is is in advanced development. SPCs can now view their own details and approve or reject student requests. Editing Personal Details is the next task.
Viewing Company details and related student information is awaiting "placement" module development
